# UnityMVC Sample Project

This repository contains a sample project that demonstrates the features and capabilities of the UnityMVC library. The UnityMVC library is designed to facilitate the implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern within Unity projects, with a particular focus on user interface management. However, it is also possible to utilize the library in other scenarios.
